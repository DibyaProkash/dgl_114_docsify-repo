## 1. Before you Begin

In this lab activity,  you will build apps by writing code in the Kotlin programming language, which is the language recommended by Google when creating new Android apps.

> ### What is Kotlin?
> Kotlin is a modern programming language that helps developers be more productive. For example, Kotlin allows you to be more concise and write fewer lines of code for the same functionality compared to other programming languages. Apps that are built with Kotlin are also less likely to crash, resulting in a more stable and robust app for users. Essentially, with Kotlin, you can write better Android apps in a shorter amount of time. As a result, Kotlin is gaining momentum in the industry and is the language that the majority of professional Android developers use.

To get started on building Android apps in Kotlin, it's important to first establish a solid foundation of programming concepts in Kotlin. With the codelabs in this pathway, you will learn about Kotlin programming basics before diving into app creation.

> ### What you'll build
> Short programs in Kotlin that display messages when you run them.

>  ### What you'll build
>   - How to write and run a simple Kotlin program.
>   - How to modify a simple program to change the output.

### What you'll need
A computer with internet access and a web browser.

## 2. Get Started
In this lab activity, you'll explore and modify simple programs in Kotlin. You can think of a program as a series of instructions for a computer or mobile device to perform some action, such as display a message to a user or calculate the cost of items in a shopping cart. The step-by-step instructions for what the computer should do is called code. When you modify the code in a program, the output can change.

You use a tool called a code editor to write and edit your code. It's similar to a text editor in which you can write and edit text, but a code editor also provides functionality to help you write code more accurately. For example, a code editor shows autocomplete suggestions while you type, and displays error messages when code is incorrect.

To practice the basics of the Kotlin language, you will use an interactive code editor called the Kotlin Playground. You can access it from a web browser, so you don't need to install any software on your computer. You can edit and run Kotlin code directly in the Kotlin Playground and see the output.

Note that you can't build Android apps within the Kotlin Playground. In later tasks, you will install and use a tool called **Android Studio** to write and edit your Android app code.

Now that you have some context on Kotlin, take a look at your first program!

### 3. Open Kotlin Playground

In a web browser on your computer, open the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/).
