# Week 1: Kotlin Basics - Pathway 1

<!-- 
Students may come to this class with little to no knowledge of the Android platform, how it is distinguished from other mobile app platforms, and how what they have already learned about coding, computational thinking and design and development relate to Android app development. Therefore, the main conceptual goals this week are to disambiguate between Android and other platforms and between Kotlin and Java (and other languages). Purely technical goals include installing Android Studio, creating a first basic app and running it on a properly configured AVD. 

Since this is the first class of the course it will be necessary to go over the syllabus and any related content. Ideally, this takes only a short amount of time so that time can be spent addressing first course content. Since this is the first class, and because of the requirements of discussing the syllabus, I forgo any lab component for this week. Providing optional activities (codelabs) or readings is appropriate. -->

## Welcome to the First Week of Kotlin for Android Development!

This week, we’ll kick off our journey into Kotlin and Android development. Whether you’re new to Android or have limited exposure to mobile app platforms, this class is designed to help you start with confidence. Here's what you can expect:

### What You’ll Learn <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- **Understanding Platforms:** Gain clarity on what makes Android unique compared to other mobile app platforms like iOS or cross-platform frameworks.
- **Kotlin vs. Java:** Explore how Kotlin differs from Java and other programming languages, and why it’s the preferred choice for Android development.
- **Setting Up Your Tools:** Install Android Studio, configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD), and create your first basic Android app!

### First Steps <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Since this is our introductory class, we’ll also review the course syllabus, expectations, and resources. This will give you a clear roadmap for the weeks ahead. We’ll keep this part brief so we can dive into the exciting world of Kotlin and Android as soon as possible.

### Optional Activities <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To reinforce what you learn this week, optional activities such as codelabs and recommended readings will be provided. These will help you explore and experiment at your own pace.
