# Week 1: Kotlin Basics - Pathway 1

## Summary 

Students may come to this class with little to no knowledge of the Android platform, how it is distinguished from other mobile app platforms, and how what they have already learned about coding, computational thinking and design and development relate to Android app development. Therefore, the main conceptual goals this week are to disambiguate between Android and other platforms and between Kotlin and Java (and other languages). Purely technical goals include installing Android Studio, creating a first basic app and running it on a properly configured AVD. 

 

Since this is the first class of the course it will be necessary to go over the syllabus and any related content. Ideally, this takes only a short amount of time so that time can be spent addressing first course content. Since this is the first class, and because of the requirements of discussing the syllabus, I forgo any lab component for this week. Providing optional activities (codelabs) or readings is appropriate.
